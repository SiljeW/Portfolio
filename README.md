Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project.

These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.

## Acknowledgments

Before starting these studies I did not realize how many developers I actually have in my network. Without mentioning any names, I would like to thank each and every one of them for never saying no when I get stuck in my own coding (especially JS).
